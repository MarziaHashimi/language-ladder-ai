# Note Feedback

💭 Reflection

Every part of this project—from planning the UI to integrating the OpenAI API—was challenging yet deeply rewarding. I learned how to manage React components, state and asynchronous API handling effectively. Connecting the app with OpenAI was the most difficult part, but it helped me understand real-world API integration. Although the app isn’t perfect, I tried my level best to make it intuitive and visually appealing. This project has truly enhanced my confidence and skills in this valuable journey.
